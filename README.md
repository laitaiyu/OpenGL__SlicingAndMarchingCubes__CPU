Describe to make Slicing and Marching Cubes (CPU Version) using OpenGL. 
Development Environment: Microsoft Windows 10, Microsoft Visual C++ 2017.

## Getting Started

Keyboard/Mouse function description

[q/Q] : Quit

[v/V] : Start/End Screenshot

Mouse instructions:
Using the GLUI design interface, the following is the Check Box, using the mouse operation.

[Part 1 & 2: Cross Sections 1 (Y Plane, Red = X)] : Switch X plane.
[Part 1 & 2: Cross Sections 2 (X Plane, Green = Y)] : Switch Y plane.
[Part 1 & 2: Cross Sections 3 (Z Plane, Blue = Z)] : Switch Z plane.
[Part 1 & 2: Cross Sections 4] : Switch Bevel.
[Part 1 & 2: Cross Sections 5 using Index method] : Animation display using Index of Volume Data.
[Part 1 & 2: Cross Sections 6 using Texture method] : Animation display using texture method.
[Part 3: Move X] : Moves in the direction of the X axis and the mouse is pressed on the left button, moving from bottom to top or from top to bottom to move the control plane.
[Part 3: Move Y] : Moves in the direction of the Y axis. The mouse is pressed on the left button and moves from bottom to top or from top to bottom. The control plane moves.
[Part 3: Move Z] : Moves in the direction of the Z axis. The mouse is pressed on the left button and moves from bottom to top or from top to bottom. The control plane moves.
[Part 3: Rotate X] : The X-axis cuts in any angle. The mouse is pressed on the left button and moves from bottom to top or from top to bottom. The control plane moves.
[Part 3: Rotate Y] : The Y-axis of any angle is cut in. The left mouse button is pressed to move from bottom to top or from top to bottom. The control plane moves.
[Part 3: Rotate Z] : The Z-axis of any angle is cut in. The left mouse button holds the mouse and moves from bottom to top or from top to bottom. The control plane moves.
[Add triangles] : In the triangle area, click the left mouse button to increase the triangle.
[Delete triangles] : In the triangle area, click the left mouse button on the triangle to delete it.
[Move triangles] : In the triangle area, click on the triangle to move the triangle position.
[Change color] : Click the color wheel first, after selecting the color, click on the triangle to change the color.
[Part 7. Display opacity effects] : Move the mouse to the color display area to draw a graph that affects transparency.
[Save to default.tfe] : Click the button to save the settings in default.tfe.
[Load to default.tfe] : Click the button to load the settings.
[Part 10. Marching Cubes CPU version] : Displays the Marching Cubes CPU Version. Only the window will work and the rest of the windows will pause.
